# E-Commerce-Back-End


## Description

Building the back-end for an e-commerce website. I will be using Express.js, mySQL, and Sequelize to build the routes needed to connect to front end and help the users retrieve the data they need. I built this project in order to help myself understand how to use Sequelize and MySQL in conjugation with Express to build api routes that take in user input and perform various actions. This project helped me learn how to incorporate MySQL with back-end api routing.

## Installation

Step 1: Run "npm i" in command line to install all the necessary packages.
Step 2: Create the database in MySQL.
Step 3: Run "npm run seed" in command line to seed the database.
Step 4: Run "npm start" to start the server.
